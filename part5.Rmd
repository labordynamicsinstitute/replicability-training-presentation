# How to Run Stata Code

##

These slides are based on [Appendix F in the training curriculum](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/replicability-training-curriculum/stata-related-procedures.html)

## config.do

## config.do

### Area 1

- Sets file paths.
- Creates a sub-directory to save logs in, if necessary.
- There will be no effect in cases where the authors create their own log files, so do not comment this area out.

### Area 2

- Creates a log file each time you run the code.
- Labels log files with the timestamp of the current run.

### Area 4

- Provides information about the system the code is run on, for the replication package.

### Area 4

- Sets file path for packages.
- Installs Stata packages needed for replication.
- You will need to add package names to line 55. (Use line 56 as an example).

##

- If there is no master.do file, add ` include config.do` at the beginning and ` log close _all` at the end.
- If there is a master.do file, add the lines to it, only.

## master.do

If the authors do not provide a master .do, but the order in which each program is run is clear (either from file names or from the README), then create a master.do as follows:

##

- Add ` include config.do` for the first line and ` log close _all` for the last line.
- For each program that needs to be run, write ` do` and the path. Make sure these lines are in the right sequence.

```
include "config.do"
 
* Assuming scenario "A"

do "${rootdir}/code/0_first_program.do" 
do "${rootdir}/code/1_second_program.do"
do "${rootdir}/code/2_third_program.do"
do "${rootdir}/code/appendix_code/appendix.do"

log close _all

```

## Modifying File Paths

- Varies depending on the replication package.
- Typically will require one modification to either the master .do file or to a program called by the master .do file. 

Before:

```
*/ This is Master do file /*

global maindir "C:\Users\Author\Dropbox\Project1" // this is the path to the repository
global data "$maindir/data" // path to data folder
global figures "$maindir/figures" // path to figures folder
```

After:

```
include "config.do"

*/ This is Master do file /*

global maindir "$rootdir" // this is the path to the repository
global data "$maindir/data" // path to data folder
global figures "$maindir/figures" // path to figures folder
```

##

- The config .do file has a parameter called `scenario` that is set to `A` by default.
- `A` indicates the case where the master .do file is in a subfolder of the root directory.
- `B` indicates the case where the master .do file is in the root directory. Change the default if needed.

Scenario A

```
 directory/
              code/
                 main.do
                 01_dosomething.do
              data/
                 data.dta
                 otherdata.dta

```

Scenario B

```
 directory/
        main.do
        scripts/
             01_dosomething.do
        data/
             data.dta
             otherdata.dta
```

## Running the Code

- Right click on the master .do file and select the option `Execute (do)`. This will set the working directory location to the location where the master .do file is, automatically.
